At its core, node.js is simply a plugin to Google&#8217;s V8 Javascript engine (the same one powering Chrome) that enables developers to run scripts outside a browser and access the filesystem and network stack. One of Javascript&#8217;s unique and powerful features is the ease with which one can write event-driven (asynchronous) code and route data through their programs without cumbersome locks, concurrency issues, and state complexities.

Node deftly incorporates these strengths in its * fully asynchronous* io libraries, making it ideal for a fast and simple web server. The community is robust and friendly, and has produced everything from rails-like frameworks to radically simple RPC. This makes it easy to write real-time web apps like twitter and foursquare (both of whom use node.js as a crucial part of their software stack).

Node is still in its infancy, but is already being used by many top tech companies like Google, Yahoo, Foursquare, and dozens of others.

In this talk, Cal Poly student Nick Artman will go over a bit of Javascript for those unfamiliar with it, then introduce node and explain why it was created. He&#8217;ll also cover what it&#8217;s so great at, some details of how it works and how to develop with it. There will be lots of examples and the second hour will be dedicated to getting people up and running with node. If you wish to participate in the workshop, please bring a laptop.
