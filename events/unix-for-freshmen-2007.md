  We had a great presentation by Seth tonight. Here are some notes from him and other CPLUG members on the event:

You can get [the PDF][1] of the handout as well as the C file from the demo.

**[C-Language FAQ][3]**

**[GDB Tutorial][4]**

**[Make Tutorial][5]**

**Using SSH:**  
On Windows, SSH is limited to text input. Arrow keys probably wont work, and you cannot easily transfer work to-from your windows machine and hornet/falcon/vogon using it. Copy paste is sketchy too.

Also, the SSH software provided by the school is limited Use PuTTy and FileZilla (both FOSS) for a better experience overall. PuTTy supports colors and is overall a faster and more efficient experience. FileZilla doesn&#8217;t crash on a regular basis like the SSH File transfer client does.

PuTTy works exactly like SSH Secure Shell. Enter vogon.csc.calpoly.edu and go.

FileZilla takes a little more configuring. Open a new &#8220;site&#8221; The type is SFTP/SSH, and the logon type is normal host is vogon.csc.calpoly.edu, port 22 Choose to have it remember your password or not, and then hit connect. At this point it works exactly like SSH Secure FTP.

On Linux/Unix/Mac there are much fancier things that can be done with SSH. Come to our Power of Unix talk for info on those advanced functions.

**[GCC on windows:][2]**

Follow instructions on Keen&#8217;s site. Setting the path may require a reboot to take affect. If you are still having trouble, ask anyone in O&#8217;Gorman&#8217;s 101 class. They&#8217;ve supposedly solved all Vista related issues and can help.

That&#8217;s All folks! Look forward to our FYM Sept. 29th! More details to follow.
