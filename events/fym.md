**Free Your Machine**

Free Your Machine happens from 10am to 2pm on a Saturday once a quarter. If you are bringing a machine to have Linux installed, [**please defragment your hard drives**][1] before you come. This often takes a long time and can prevent us from installing.

We install *Ubuntu 14.04* or *Linux Mint 16 *by default, but if you would like another distribution installed, bring a disc and we&#8217;ll help you if we can. Please note that most of our members are more familiar with Debian/Ubuntu, so you&#8217;ll have the most support with one of those variants.

Your computer must be able to boot from a CD-ROM or a USB drive, or from the network (PXE boot).  If you cannot boot from either, or if your computer cannot run Windows, or if you have really really weird hardware, please [contact our mailing list][2] directly so that we can be prepared for you.
