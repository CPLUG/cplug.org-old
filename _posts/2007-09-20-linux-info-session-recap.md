We had a great presentation by Seth tonight. Here are some notes from him and other cplugers on the event:

You can get [the PDF](http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~vmeyerso/cplug/) from http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~vmeyerso/cplug/ as well 
 as the C file from the demo.

**Using SSH:**  

 On Windows, SSH is limited to text input. Arrow keys probably wont
 work, and you cannot easily transfer work to-from your windows machine
 and hornet/falcon/vogon using it. Copy paste is sketchy too.

Also, the SSH client provided by the school is limited Use PuTTy and 
 FileZilla (both FOSS) for a better experience overall. PuTTy supports
 colors and is overall a faster and more efficient experience. FileZilla
 doesn't crash on a regular basis like the SSH File transfer client does.

PuTTy works exactly like SSH Secure Shell. Enter vogon.csc.calpoly.edu
 and go.

FileZilla takes a little more configuring. Open a new "site"
 The type is SFTP/SSH, and the logon type is normal
 host is vogon.csc.calpoly.edu, port 22
 Choose to have it remember your password or not, and then hit
 connect. At this point it works exactly like SSH Secure FTP.

On Linux/Unix/Mac there are much fancier things that can be done with
 SSH. Come to our Power of Unix talk for info on those advanced functions.

 Follow instructions on Keen's site. Setting the path may require a
 reboot to take affect.

That's All folks! Look forward to our FYM Sept. 29th! More details to follow.
