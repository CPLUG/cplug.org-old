That&#8217;s right boys and girls, it&#8217;s time for the leaving seniors to part their infinite wisdom upon you in ways you never thought possible.

WHAT: Power of UNIX talk.  
WHAT? Learn how to use the commandline of your linux or unix based system.  
WHERE: Bldg 14, Room 30\[1,2,3\] (somewhere upstairs in the compsci building)  
WHEN: Thursday, Oct 18th 7:00PM.  
WHY? Because the commandline is better than a loaf of bread (yet equal in awesomeness to sliced bread).

This event was a great success last year, so we&#8217;re doing it again. Come by to learn or share as your experience allows.  
All ages, genders, and majors welcome.
