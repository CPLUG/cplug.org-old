Welcome back from winter break! CPLUG will be hosting our traditional [Free Your Machine](/events/fym) event on **Saturday, January 16** starting at **10am**, in 20-124 (the Networks lab).

Friday Linux Help will *not* be continuing this quarter. Instead we will incorporate this into general meetings on **Thursday afternoons**. Details TBA, but we have some fun talks and workshops lined up. Watch this post for updates.
