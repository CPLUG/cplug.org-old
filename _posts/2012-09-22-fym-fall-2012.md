**What:** [Free Your Machine][1]  
**When:** Saturday, October 6th, 10am-2pm  
**Where:** 197-204 (Security Lab)  
[Facebook event][2]

Come have CPLUG install Linux on your machine! We can also troubleshoot any Linux related problems you have, or you can even just show up to hang out.

By default, we will dual boot your machine with Linux Mint (an excellent Linux distribution) so you won&#8217;t lose your current OS.  We’ll have Linux Mint 13 and Ubuntu 12.04 disks on hand, and we can help you install another distribution if you bring your own disks.

The event will take place in the Security Lab (197-204) from 10am to 2pm. Fatte’s pizza will be available for $1 per slice.

If you have any questions about the event or Linux in general, feel free to [chat with us on IRC][3] at #cplug on freenode.net.

Thanks, and we hope to see you there!
