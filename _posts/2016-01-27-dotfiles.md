Are you rocking some crazy configurations? Got graceful Git aliases? A slick shell prompt? Wonderful window management? Just want to be inspired to make your own computer usage efficient and fun?

Come to the CPLUG Dotfiles Party on **January 28 at 5pm** in **14-256**. Bring your laptop and share with the rest of the group! We'll have a projector ready to go for quick lightning-style demonstrations.

We will also be offering free Linux help beforehand from **3:30-5pm** in the **Networks Lab (20-124)**.
