Our first general meeting of this quarter (indeed, our first in some years) will be this Thursday, October 17 at 5pm in 14-232B (inside the CSL).

Come with your questions and knowledge about anything Linux-related.

We&#8217;ll also discuss upcoming events, and eat pizza (thanks iFixit!).

Finally, we&#8217;ll have a bit of meta-planning of future meetings.
