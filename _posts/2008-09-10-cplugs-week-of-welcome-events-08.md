WOW starts in about a week, and the Execboard is planning on having strong presence for several events that week. However, we can&#8217;t do everything ourselves, so we need help for the following events. Any help (even if just for preparation or set up / tear down) is greatly appreciated. Let&#8217;s show the freshmen that Linux nerds know how to represent (stabs self for such an awful phrase).

**SLO Bound &#8211; Tuesday Sep 16th 12-2:30PM**

Freshmen will be walking the steets of San Luis Obispo going to various places of business. I&#8217;d like 6-7 people to give out 20 copies of our OpenCD with a flier telling them to visit our booth at the club fair and with the club web site on them. We&#8217;ll need help making the CD&#8217;s and fliers (probably Friday night or Saturday), and handing them out. You won&#8217;t have to be downtown all 2.5 hours, just long enough to hand out your CD&#8217;s, although I&#8217;d like to space out the people handing them out (2 every 30 minutes) to get a wide spread of discs. Volunteers requested for 30 minute shifts.

**CSC Luncheon &#8211; Wednesday Sep 17th 11AM-1PM**

CSC and SE majors will be introduced to their Faculty, and ACM usually speaks. I say if ACM is there, we should be too. I did this last year, spoke about 1 minutes on the club, and then sat down and talked with freshmen during lunch about the club, the campus, or whatever they wanted. I&#8217;d like 2 people to help me outÂ  with this. There&#8217;s a free lunch in it for you if you want it.

**WOW Block Party &#8211; Friday Sep 19th 4-7:30PM**  
Setup @ 3:00PM / Teardown @ 8:00PM (or maybe earlier)

Looking for people for 1hr+ shifts. Sit down, talk to freshmen about the club, hand out free stuff, good times for all. Bring a laptop if you can, especially if you&#8217;re running something cool (compiz fusion, any non-GNOME or KDE desktop, eeePC, OLPC, video production), although I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to have power (don&#8217;t expect it). Bring a chair as well if you&#8217;d like to sit, no idea if we&#8217;ll have any provided.

Execboard can&#8217;t do this alone, please respond with the events/times you can help out so we can make this WOW a success.
