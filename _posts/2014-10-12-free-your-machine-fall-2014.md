What: Free Your Machine  
When: Saturday, October 18, 10am-2pm  
Where: 20-124 (Networks Lab)  
[Facebook event][1]

Come have CPLUG help install Linux on your computer! We can also troubleshoot any Linux-related problems you have, or you can just show up to hang out.

We will dual boot your machine with Linux Mint (an excellent Linux distribution) so you won’t lose your current OS. We’ll have Linux Mint 17 and Ubuntu 14.04 flash drives on hand, and we can help you install another distribution if you bring your own installation media.
