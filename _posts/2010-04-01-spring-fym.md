Hey you guys!  
This is a reminder for the free your machine event the 4th Saturday of the quarter! We’ll install linux for you and we can have your machine dual boot so you won’t lose your current OS. FYM will be in 20-124 from 10-2 (no new installs accepted after 1:30!). So come over to get linux installed, get linux questions answered, or just hang out! So in short:

WHAT: FYM  
WHEN: SATURDAY, April 24, 10AM-2PM  
WHERE: 20-124

See you there!
