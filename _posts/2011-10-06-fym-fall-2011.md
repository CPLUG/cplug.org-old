WHAT: CPLUG&#8217;s Fall Free Your Machine  
WHEN: Saturday, October 8, 10AM-2PM  
WHERE: Bldg 197, Rm 204 (Security Lab)

Come have CPLUG install Ubuntu Linux on your machine! We can also troubleshoot any Linux related problems you have, or you can even just show up to hang out.

By default, we will dual boot your machine with Ubuntu, so you won&#8217;t lose your current OS. We’ll have Ubuntu 11.04 disks on hand to install for new users, and we can help you install another distribution if you bring your own disks.

The event will take place in the Security Lab (197-204) from 10AM to 2PM. Fatte&#8217;s pizza will be available for $1 per slice.

For more information about Free Your Machine, please visit <a title="http://cplug.org/fym" href="http://cplug.org/fym" target="_blank">http://cplug.org/fym</a>. RSVP on facebook [here][1].

If you have any questions about the event or Linux in general, feel free to chat with us on IRC at #cplug on <a title="freenode.net" href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=cplug" target="_blank">freenode.net</a>.

Thanks, and we hope to see you there!
