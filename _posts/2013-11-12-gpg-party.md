Where: 14-232B  
[Facebook event][1]

In place of a general meeting this week, come learn how to use PGP encryption to communicate securely.

We&#8217;ll explain some of the ideas behind PGP, then demonstrate using GnuPG and Enigmail to create a public/private key pair and exchange encrypted email. Finally, we can all sign each other&#8217;s keys to expand the so-called &#8220;web of trust&#8221;.

To participate, please bring:  
1. A photo ID. Your Cal Poly ID or driver&#8217;s license will do.  
2. A computer with Thunderbird installed and configured for your email account:
