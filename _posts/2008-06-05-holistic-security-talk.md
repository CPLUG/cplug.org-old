There will be a talk on system security tonight, June 5th, at 5pm to 7pm in <strike>22-315</strike> **14-301**

The first hour will go over the basics of holisitic security, and the second hour we will relocate to 14-301 to practice implementing said security and hacking into a machine with incomplete security.

This meeting is sponsored and given by Dr. Staley&#8217;s company [CreateSpace][1].

The flyer is [here][2]. (in odt format&#8230;)

**The talk has been moved to 14-301! **
