WHAT: CPLUG&#8217;s Free Your Machine Event  
WHEN: Saturday, October 16, 10AM-2PM  
WHERE: 20-124 (Networks Lab)

This Satuday, CPLUG (Cal Poly Linux Users Group) will host FYM (Free  
Your Machine).  FYM is a great chance to get Linux installed on your  
own system, meet other Linux users, and eat lots of pizza.  By  
default, we will dual boot your machine with Ubuntu (an excellent  
Linux distribution) so you won&#8217;t lose your current OS.  We’ll have  
Ubuntu 10.04 disks on hand to install for new users, and we can help  
you install another distribution if you bring your own disks.  The  
event will take place in the Networks Lab (20-124) from 10AM to 2PM.  
If you have any questions about Linux in general, either come to the  
event or chat with us on IRC at #<cplug@freenode.net>

See you there!
