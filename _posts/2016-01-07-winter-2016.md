Welcome back from winter break! CPLUG will be hosting our traditional Free Your Machine event on **Saturday, January 16** starting at **10am**, location TBA.

Friday Linux Help will *not* be continuing this quarter. Instead we will incorporate this into general meetings on **Thursday afternoons**. Details TBA, but we have some fun talks and workshops lined up. Watch this post for updates.
