Our sincere apologies to anyone who ended up wandering the English building looking for us. It was quite a typo.

Upcoming May Events

**5/6 &#8211; Bash Scripting Talk of Doom Death** (Tentative, but appropriate, title)  
Josh, aka SillyG, aka President of CPLUG, will be giving a talk on BASH scripting Tuesday May 13th at 7pm in a room to be determined. A lot of us have been waiting for this to happen, so come on by and learn a thing or two.

Update: Check our facebook group (cplug) and the BASH event through there for location, time, etc.
