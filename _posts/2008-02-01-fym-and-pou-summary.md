Hey Guys,

Thanks to everyone who showed up to our events this month. If you have any questions feel free to contact us. mgius would also like to say this about getting to know CPLUG:

> There are 2 main ways to get active in the club. The first is the [Mailing List][1]. Just sign up for announce and cplug and go from there. The second way to hear about events, ask questions, and get to know us is through our IRC channel. We are #cplug on Freenode.net. If you need help setting up IRC we recommend XChat for Linux & Windows. Our mac users reccomend different things, but I&#8217;ve heard Colloquy, and if you use Pidgin/Gaim it has (bad) IRC support. For help on setting up IRC check this [link][2].

Hope to see you guys soon at some of our other events or online.

/Nat
