Hey you guys!  
This is a reminder for the free your machine event this saturday! We’ll install linux for you and we can have your machine dual boot so you won’t lose your current OS. FYM will be in 20-124 at 10-2 (no new installs accepted after 1:30!). So come over to get linux installed, get linux questions answered, or just hang out! So in short:

WHAT: FYM  
WHEN: SATURDAY, October 3, 10-2  
WHERE: 20-124

See you there!
