Hey you guys!  
This is a reminder for the free your machine event next Saturday! (After the 3-day weekend) We’ll install linux for you and we can have your machine dual boot so you won’t lose your current OS. FYM will be in 20-124 from 10-2 (no new installs accepted after 1:30!). So come over to get linux installed, get linux questions answered, or just hang out! So in short:

WHAT: FYM  
WHEN: SATURDAY, January 23, 10AM-2PM  
WHERE: 20-124

See you there!
