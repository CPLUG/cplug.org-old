Hey guys we have two events in the next few days:

First, tonight, Thursday, **Power of Unix**. POU is an introduction to some interesting commands that people tend to not know about, or how to use.

**Where: 14-301**  
**When: Thursday 1/22/09 7pm**  
**Who: CPLUG Execboard**

Saturday we will be having our quarterly **Free Your Machine**. We will install linux on any machine, although if you have very strange hardware, or your machine can&#8217;t run Windows, please contact us beforehand so that we can be prepared.  Please remember that if you wish to dual boot, you need to defragment windows before you come.  See http://cplug.org/fym for more information.

**Where: 20-124**  
**When: Saturday 10am to 2pm**  
**Who: Anyone!**
