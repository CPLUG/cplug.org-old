It's time to get in your votes for next year's CPLUG Executive Board. Which of these fine young nominees will steer the Linux Users Group for
 the next school year?
  
  

 Send your votes in to [EXECBOARD at CPLUG dot ORG](mailto:execboard@cplug.org) (one vote per position) by
 11:59:59 PM, Wednesday, May 3rd to be counted.
  
  

 **Red Wagner (redson): President**
  
  

 As it has been suggested that each of us launch promotional material to
 endorse ourselves for our positions, and because of the fact that my
 attempt at running for President last year was thwarted by a spam
 filter, I give you my candidacy plea from a year ago (It's slightly
 different than what I would have written now, as I didn't know most of
 you that well. and I modified it a bit...) :
  
  

 ------------begin original------------------------------------- 
  
  

 Some would point out that I am not very qualified as I have "not been"
 to a CPLUG meeting, but I believe this to be a vile lie and a moot
 point. First of all, as I have been absent from Cal Poly for two years,
 it would have been hard for me to be a member in previous years, but
 during this time I did attend the UCLALUG as well as the USCLUG, so I
 have very much been involved in the community. Also, most of the CPLUG
 conversation takes place in #cplug, which I frequent, and I will attend
 the FYM event on April 16th to meet more of the CPLUG in person and try
 and recruit new members.
  
  

 Lastly, as the current Linux admin for the Cisco Networking lab, I'll
 always be able to unlock the door for meetings. ;-)

 **Derek Lockhart (TheDiff): Vice President, President**
  
  

 CPLUG has always been a club of great integrity and prosperity. It has
 been an icon rising above the sea of mediocre Cal Poly clubs, a
 benchmark by which other clubs judge themselves. As Vice President of
 CPLUG, I intend to uphold the great tradition of past CPLUG execboards,
 as well as guide this great and righteous organization towards continued
 success. (APPLAUSE)
  
  

 But my vision for CPLUG extends beyond the continued propagation of the
 clubs lineage; rather I hope to expand the contribution of the club in
 both the campus and San Luis Obispo communities. (APPLAUSE) I, in
 cooperation with the rest of the CPLUG board, hope to improve both the
 quality and quantity of events which CPLUG hosts, as well as increase
 the utility of said events to the community and the club.
  
  

 Most importantly, as a club which promotes open source software, CPLUG
 serves an important role as an informational and assistive resource to
 those who are not familiar with Linux and the software which runs on it.
 However, there are some other software development ideologies that hate
 our concept of freedom, and would do anything to attack it. These
 individuals are freedom haters, extremists, and probably even
 terrorists. We must do more to defend ourselves against threats to our
 freedom, and to protect our way of life. (APPLAUSE) I urge you all to
 support my candidacy and my hope to create a CPLUG Department of OS
 Security. It is the only way we can defend ourselves against the
 surrounding hordes of defective, unusable, and dirty proprietary
 software. 
  
  

 We wage a war to save civilization itself. We did not seek it, but we
 will fight it and we will prevail. (APPLAUSE)
  
  

 My fellow CPLUGers, let's Roll.
 (APPLAUSE)
  
  
**Keith McCabe (kmccabe): Vice President**  
  

 I've been idling in IRC for a while and apparently got nominated
 (that'll teach me to show up to meetings). Some people tell me I am
 responsible, but I'm not sure I believe them. I'm one of those people
 who lists "Linux" as a hobby, probably because I keep finding myself
 installing Gentoo. My other hobbies consist of coding and satellites.
 I'm primarily throwing my name in the ring because I'll be here next
 year, and really think the LUG is a good group of people. (Shameless
 flattery gets me votes, right?)
  
  

 **Rohen Peterson (Ozymandius): Secretary**
  
  

 I'm running for the 2006-2007 position of CPLUG Secretary.
  
  

 The role of secretary includes moderating the mail-lists, recording the
 events of the meetings, posting news, and other administrative issues.
 The secretary is also the person that stops the 9 billion spam messages
 from hitting your personal box. I am very active in the LUG (and am
 the current Secretary) and most news is posted as soon as I get
 confirmation from the officers, as I live on IRC.
  
  

 I'm a 3rd year CPE and 2nd year member (because Travis wouldn't let me
 pay dues and join the first time in Spring 04). I use Gentoo Linux, and
 have used Ubuntu, RedHat, Fedora, SuSe, and Mandrake. I also use VIM.
  
  

 My goal for the LUG is to expand the advertising to encompass more than
 just the EE/CSC buildings. I would like to set up advanced planning so
 that we can start posting Campus Wide Announcements on the My CalPoly
 frontpage.
  
  

 PS - Join The Committee to Re-Elect the Present Secretary (CREEPS)
 campaign!
  
  

 **David Sharp (whereami): Treasurer**
  
  

 Next year, I will be a Senior majoring in Computer Enigeering. I have
 learned a lot about Linux over the past three years, and love
 spreading the good news. Gentoo is my distro of choice, so you know
 I'm hard core! (maybe.) I have been a member of CPLUG since I
 discovered it my freshman year, but haven't done a lot for the club
 other than helping people in the channel. So, now I want to help the
 club grow and spread the cause of Linux. F{ree,ix}YM are great, but I
 think we can do more to get our name out there. If that means buying a
 penguin suit and coercing professors or members into mildly
 embarassing but extremely hilarious and, more importantly, highly
 visible situations, then that's where the money needs to go. Pizza is
 always good too.
  
  

 **Garret Garcia (ggarcia): Treasurer**
  
  

 First of all, I'm honored to be included among the nominees. 
  
  

 I'm a CSC. This is my third year at Poly, and I have two more to go. I'm eager to become more active within CPLUG and serving as Treasurer seems like a good way of getting involved. As for qualifications... I was the Treasurer of my Junior High School in eighth grade, and also my freshman year of high school. My skills may be a little rusty, but I am confident that my knowledge of the fine art of Treasuring will return to me with little trouble. If I am elected, the CPLUG will enter a new era of wealth and prosperity that previously could only be attained by slightly larger Linux User Groups!
  
  

 In all seriousness, I believe that I would do a good job as Treasurer. This club has great potential both as a resource to new Linux users and as an encouragement for those who have yet to cross over to do so. Win or lose, I'm glad to be a part of it. In conclusion: I like Linux. I like the CPLUG. And I like money. Your votes will be appreciated.
  
  

 P.S. Here is a picture of what my reaction may look like if I win: http://www.famousplagiarists.com/images/leskomatthew.jpg
  
  

 **Jimson Xu: President, Treasurer**
  
  

 I don't know anything about being treasurer. But I am generally good
 with
 money. Those things go together right? So vote me for treasurer! I'm
 not 
 aiming for president, but if I somehow win that position by satan's
 touch, I 
 will still accept it...if that's what the votes say. But my vote for 
 president is for Red! Go Red!
