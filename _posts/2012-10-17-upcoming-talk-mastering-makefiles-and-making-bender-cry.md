**When:** Saturday, October 20th, 10:30 AM &#8211; 12:00 PM

CPLUG is excited to host a talk this Saturday by Bash evangelist and ASM madman Timothy Goya, who will be discussing advanced makefile design, code coverage analysis, and low-level application profiling. No prior experience in these areas are required, but come prepared to learn!

Students in or planning to take Dr. Staley&#8217;s CPE 305 class are encouraged to attend, as the skills taught will be valuable for this course especially.

Thanks, and we hope to see you there!
