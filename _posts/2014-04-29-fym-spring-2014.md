# Free Your Machine Spring 2014

Come to **20-124** (The networks lab in Engineering East) between 10am &#8212; 2pm this **Saturday, May 3**, to release your computer from the bonds of proprietary software, and come into the light that is FOSS!  
Anyone is welcome to come, from the guy who vaguely understands what linux is, to the programmer who is tired of Debian and wants to try Gentoo instead.

Stop by this Saturday and see what your computer is really capable of! We currently install Linux Mint 16 and Ubuntu 14.04. We can also assist with the installation of more advanced distros by request.
