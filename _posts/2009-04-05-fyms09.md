Hey you guys!  
This is a reminder for the free your machine event this saturday! We&#8217;ll install linux for you and we can have your machine dual boot so you won&#8217;t lose your current OS. FYM will be in 20-124 at 10-2 (no new installs accepted after 1:30!). So come over to get linux installed, get linux questions answered, or just hang out! So in short:

WHAT: FYM  
WHEN: SATURDAY, APRIL 11, 10-2  
WHERE: 20-124

See you there!

Also, there is a Robocode Tournament this open house, get coding.
