**What:** [Free Your Machine][1]  
**When:** Saturday, January 26th, 10am-2pm  
**Where:** 197-204 (Security Lab)  
[Facebook event][2]

Come have CPLUG install Linux on your computer! We can also troubleshoot any Linux related problems you have, or you can even just show up to hang out.

We will dual boot your machine with Linux Mint (an excellent Linux distribution) so you won&#8217;t lose your current OS. We’ll have Linux Mint 14 and Ubuntu 12.10 disks on hand, and we can help you install another distribution if you bring your own disks.

Free Fatte’s pizza will be available, courtesy of our friends at [iFixit][3]&mdash;they&#8217;re [hiring for internships][4]!

If you have any questions about the event or Linux in general, feel free to [chat with us on IRC][5] at #cplug on freenode.net.
