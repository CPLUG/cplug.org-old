Since ACM has decided to hold their first meeting of the year at the  
same time as our Introduction to UNIX talk, and the presenter for that  
talk has requested a later date due to other obligations, we&#8217;re  
postponing Intro to UNIX until Jan 20th. Sorry for that late notice.

New Date: Jan 20th  
When: 7:00pm  
Where: 14-301  
Who: The Legendary Mark Gius

Intro to unix is for anyone who would like to learn the basics of the unix/linux command line. This event, like all of our events, is free of charge.
