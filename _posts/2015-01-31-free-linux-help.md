CPLUG offers free Linux help every Friday in 20-124 (Engineering East Networks Lab) from 1pm to 2:30pm. We are available to help with any problem you might have, including any of the following:

* Dual-Booting Linux
* Running Linux in a Virtual Machine
* Troubleshooting driver issues
* Configuring complicated packages like LaTeX and X11
* Making your use of Linux more productive
* ...And much more.

Even if you don't have an issue, come check us out, just to hang out and talk about Linux.

Here's our schedule for what officer will be helping in what week. That officer's distro of choice is also included in case you have a problem specific to one of those distros.

* 2/6 Vignesh Kalidas (OS X) and Jacob Hladky (Gentoo)
* 2/13 Robin Choudhury (Arch) and Jacob Hladky (Gentoo)
