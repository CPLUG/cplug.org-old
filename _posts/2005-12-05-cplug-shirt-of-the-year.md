Ladies and gentlemen....
 THERE IS A WINNER!
 
 This decision was a long and hard one, but after a stamina-draining session of, um, head banging, we have come to a climatic end.

 For those of you interesting in purchasing a t-shirt and supporting the CPLUG, please e-mail your request to execboard at cplug dot org . Prices will be announced once we have the total number of orders, but it should be pretty reasonable.
 
 Any questions can also be directed to execboard at cplug dotorg in regards to the t-shirts.
