I realize this site hasn&#8217;t been updated in a while, but I&#8217;m gonna go ahead and grease the joints and blow the dust off this old thing. Anyway, CPLUG will be hosting the Spring FYM on Saturday, April 9, 2011. It will run from about 10AM to 2PM. Everyone and anyone is invited to show up, whether it be to have Ubuntu Linux loaded on their machine, or whether it is to just hang out with us and shoot the breeze. The meeting will be taking place in the Bonderson building (197) in room 204, courtesy of our friends in the Whitehat club (<http://www.thewhitehat.org/>).
