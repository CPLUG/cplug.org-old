Hello ladies and gentlemen!

Welcome back to school and another year of epic penguin goodness!

If you are a freshman, or just new to unix based operating systems, check out our event on the 20th in the CSC building. Also if you are interested, our famous Free Your Machine (FYM) will be happening in early October, keep your eyes open for more info.

Good luck to all!
