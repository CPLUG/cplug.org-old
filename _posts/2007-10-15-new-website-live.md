That&#8217;s right fellow penguin lovers, the new CPLUG website is live!

There are still a few bugs to work out, and we still need to clean up the old information, and port over user profiles, but we have decided to put up the site now just to be amazing.

If you have any complaints, log them either on [IRC][1] or on the mailing list, or even email execboard at cplug dot org.

look forward to more updates every monday night.
