This event is intended to help new students who are unfamiliar with Linux gain a foothold on the command line. It will include basic commands, time saving tricks, and attendance from CPLUG members who love answering questions. This talk will cover tools necessary to succeed in the introductory courses.

Fatteâ€™s pizza will be available.

If you have any questions about the event or Linux in general, feel free to [chat with us on IRC][2] at #cplug on freenode.net.

Thanks, and we hope to see you there!
