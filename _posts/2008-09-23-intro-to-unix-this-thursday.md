Hey there Cal Poly-ites,

This thursday, September 25th 2008, we will be giving a talk on how to navigate a Unix and or Linux system, like the ones in the Computer Science department labs. Here is the info from our announce list:

**When: Thursday, Sep 25th @ 7PM  
Where: Bldg 14, Room 301 (Upstairs in the CSC Building)**

Are you taking your first class in the Computer Science Department? Do you want to learn a bit about the computers that you&#8217;ll be using for the rest of the quarter or Cal Poly career? Come to Intro to Unix to learn  
the basics of Linux/Unix commandlines. CPLUG Veterans are welcome to come and answer questions and help out.
