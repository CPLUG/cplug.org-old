Coming soon to the Cal Poly Computer Science Department, from the people who brought you the cult classic &#8220;Linux for Newbs&#8221; and the Broadway hit &#8220;Lone Single Man presenting SVN&#8221; comes another technical talk that has all the ladies talking, &#8220;Man with Hat juggling Camels teaches you Perl&#8221;!

**When: November 3rd, 7pm 2008**  
**Where: Cal Poly SLO Computer Science Building, 14-301**

This presentation will be done by our very own President, Austin Hendrix, and will provide an introductory look into Perl, how to use it, and why all the cool kids have been using it since 1987.

We look forward to seeing you then!
