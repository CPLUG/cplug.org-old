We had a great turnout last week at the CPLUG and CreateSpace Holistic Security Talk.

Definition of Holistic : Emphasizing the importance of the whole and the interdependence of its parts.

We are still trying to get a digital copy of the notes, but the talk covered security holes and how when creating a system you need to focus on every part of the system. If it is week anywhere then the entire system is flawed.

The talk was given by Mark Smith, the Lead System Admin from CreateSpace.

After the talk Mark led us in a contest to crack a set of unsecured virtual machines. after three hours of attempts, the only person to finish was Mark Gius, our very own Treasurer.

Thanks to Mark Smith and everyone who came out. We are done with meetings for this year, we hope to see you all in the fall.

UPDATE:Â  There were actually 3 persons to finish the tasks, Mark was only the first one.
