Welcome back, CPLUGers! Join us for our first general meeting of the school year on **Monday, October 12 at 6pm** in 14-247!

We'll go over some history of the club, what we do, what we plan to do, and get feedback from you on what you would like to see.

Come with your questions and ideas about anything Linux-related.

If you can't make it, be sure to stay tuned for future events. Our weekly Linux help sessions continue to be held on Fridays at 1pm in 20-124.
