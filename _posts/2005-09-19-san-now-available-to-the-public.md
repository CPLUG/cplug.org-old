The Storage Area Network is now available for access to all. Its address is [http://san.csc.calpoly.edu](http://san.csc.calpoly.edu). The SAN contains valuable Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu and Linux kernel resources, available for use in apt-get, portage, and other regular uses. Congratulations to red0x and cappaberra on their work building and maintaining the SAN!
