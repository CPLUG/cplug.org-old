Do you want Linux installed on the machine of your choice for free? Do you want to hang with awesome people? Do you need an excuse to eat large amounts of pizza? If you even considered answering yes to any of those questions, then come to the CPLUG Free Your Machine this weekend.

**When: Â Saturday, Oct 4th from 10AM to 2PM  
Where: Bldg 20, Room 124 (Cisco Networks Lab)**

Please try to show up as early as possible, we will not be starting installs after 1pm.

Although not required, we would appreciate it if you sent an email to execboard at <a href="http://lists.cplug.org/" target="_blank">lists.cplug.org</a> with the subject &#8220;Fall FYM&#8221; letting us know your name, and your computers processor, graphics card, and wireless card, ifyou plan on needing help with an install.
