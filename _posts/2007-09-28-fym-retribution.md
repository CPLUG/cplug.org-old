Room: 20-124

Do you want to join the elite ranks of programmers on the Cal Poly campus? Then come to Free Your Machine this Saturday and have an experienced group of Linux Veterans install Linux on your computer free of charge. It&#8217;s a completely free operating system and set of programs continually improved by a vast community of developers. Many Cal Poly computer science and engineering courses are based around Linux, so the earlier you get familiar with it, the faster you&#8217;ll be up and running in those courses.

[Pre-registration][1] is recommended, so we can gauge space and personnel.

Look forward to seeing you there!
