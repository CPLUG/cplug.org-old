Many thanks to Casey Klein for giving a fun and informative talk on Scheme! In addition to his [slides](schemetalk.pdf), created using [slideshow](http://www.plt-scheme.org/software/slideshow/), here is a list of recommended resources for more infromation on Scheme.

Programming Environment:   
  
 [PLT Scheme](http://www.plt-scheme.org)   

 Notes: Package includes both DrScheme IDE and MzScheme command-line interpreter. DrScheme supports a bunch of Scheme dialects (and even some non-Schemes); select the PLT-\>Pretty Big language to get started.

General Resources:   
  
 [How to Use Scheme](http://www.htus.org/)  
  
 [The Schematics Scheme Cookbook](http://schemecookbook.org)   
  
 [The Scheme Programming Language](http://www.scheme.com/tspl3/)   
  
 [PLT Scheme Mailing List](http://www.plt-scheme.org/maillist/)

Macro Resources:  
  
 [
 The Swine Before Perl](http://technetcast.ddj.com/tnc_play_stream.html?stream_id=644) (slides and accompanying audio)  
  
 [Automata via Macros](http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-automata-macros/)  

 Notes: Paper is the "extended exposition" of the presentation above.  
  
 [Writing Hygienic Macros in Scheme with syntax-case](ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/scheme-repository/doc/pubs/iucstr356.ps.gz)
