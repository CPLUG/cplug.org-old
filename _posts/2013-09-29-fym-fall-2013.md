**What:** [Free Your Machine][1]  
**When:** Saturday, October 5, 9am-1pm  
**Where:** 197-204 (Security Lab)  
[Facebook event][2]

Update: [UEFI lessons learned][3]

Come have CPLUG install Linux on your computer! We can also troubleshoot any Linux related problems you have, or you can even just show up to hang out.

We will dual boot your machine with [Linux Mint][4] (an excellent Linux distribution) so you won’t lose your current OS. We’ll have Linux Mint 15 and Ubuntu 13.04 disks/flash drives on hand, and we can help you install another distribution if you bring your own installation media.

Free Fatte’s pizza will be available, courtesy of our friends at iFixit. They’re [hiring for internships][5]!

If you have any questions about the event or Linux in general, [chat with us on IRC][6].
