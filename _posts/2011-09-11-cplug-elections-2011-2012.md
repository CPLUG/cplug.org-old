Welcome back to school, CPLUGers! Believe it or not, it&#8217;s officer election time again!

The following positions will be available:

To run for a position, you need to do the following things:

1.  Submit a short paragraph to execboard at cplug.org about who you are including name/major/year, what position you&#8217;re running for, IRC nick, and why you want to be on the execboard.
2.  If you haven&#8217;t yet, introduce yourself to the IRC channel (http://cplug.org/irc).

The deadline to submit applications is Tuesday, September 13th by 7am. Results should be posted by midnight of the same day.

Good luck and have fun! :-)
