We will be giving our quarterly Intro to Unix talk Saturday, 11/5 at 5PM in 14-302.

Intro to Unix is a quarterly talk aimed at new students and those who are unfamiliar with Linux to gain a foothold on the command line. We will cover basic commands, introduce time saving tricks, and answer  
any questions you may have.

The talk will cover what is necessary to succeed in the introductory 100-level courses.
