CPLUG is organizing a Robocode tournament for Cal Poly&#8217;s Open House this year.

[Robocode][1] lets you program virtual robots in Java. The robots drive around and shoot at each other in a battle for glory!

The [Sourceforge download][2] contains full Javadoc API documentation, and source code for several example robots. If that&#8217;s not enough for you, the [Robocode wiki][3] has detailed discussions on winning strategies.

The tournament will take place:  
**14-309** (Software Development Lab)  
**Friday, the 17th** 12:30-3:00PM.  
**Saturday the 18th** 11:00AM-3:00PM.

I am currently planning to have melee rounds on Friday, and one-on-one rounds on Saturday. All battles will take place on a big screen where prospective students will get to watch and see how awesome Cal Poly CSC majors are. You will not need to be present during the event, although we hope you will attend.

Separate winners will be announced both for one-on-one and melee combat.

Entries may be submitted [via our online form][4].

## Rules stuff

Somebody decided that a contest needs rules. Go figure.

The submission deadline is *midnight of Thursday, April 16*, as the event will start on the 17th. You can try submitting stuff later, but it will probably get lost in the shuffle, and that would suck.

There will be prizes provided by the CSC department for both one-and-one and melee divisions. No, I haven&#8217;t been told what they are.

Copying and pasting code from existing world championship robots is not allowed, but you probably guessed that.

I&#8217;m going to be fairly lenient on what I consider plagiarism. The example robots that come with Robocode are fair game to copy from, since they all suck.

I will also allow people to borrow from the *short* code examples on the Robocode wiki. If the code example is complete enough to form an entire class definition, it&#8217;s not &#8220;short&#8221;. As an example, most of the &#8220;locks&#8221; on the [radar page][5] are acceptable to borrow from, especially if you&#8217;re making your own modifications to the sample code.

You may also borrow *ideas* from exiting Robocode robots, *if you are not actually copying and pasting code*.

Finally, the judge(s) are allowed to exercise common sense, and their decisions will be final.
