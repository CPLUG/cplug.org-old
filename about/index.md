We are CPLUG, the Cal Poly Linux Users Group. We're both users and fans of the GNU/Linux Operating System, and we want you to be too. We have regular talks and meetings, as well as social events when the opportunity arises.

The best way to stay up to date on events and meetings is to join the [Facebook group][] or come hang out on our [IRC channel][]. Feel free to ask questions, start some chatter, enjoy the chaos, or whatever else floats your boat. We hope to see you out in the Real World at one of our meetings.

You can learn more about

 * our esteemed [alumni][], many of whom work at major companies like Apple and Google
 * the [history][] of CPLUG from 1996 to the present
